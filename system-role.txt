About Me
Bridging the gap between biotechnology and software development

View Projects
Contact Me
Background
I have always loved technology from a very young age. It didn't matter that I chose to study biotechnology because it bridges the gap between the research world and the technological or innovative world. During my 100-level days, I got myself a laptop and became a self-taught programmer. Ever since then, Iâ€™ve engaged in several projects and have continued to improve steadily.
